"""The desktop app.

    python -m awrbc.desktop

A Python process hosting the editor in the operating system's webview
(pywebview). The codec is an import rather than a subprocess, and the frontend
is the same one the website serves - nothing is written twice (decision #51).

This is what makes the whole thing usable. Getting a map into a save was
always going to be the step most players failed at, and a terminal was never
going to be how they did it.

Save access exists here because a Python process is hosting the page. The
hosted build has no equivalent and no code path to a file system (#52), so the
boundary is structural rather than a promise.
