"""Typed errors raised by core.

core never prints and never exits. It raises from here and the CLI maps these
to messages and exit codes.

The exit codes are a contract beyond this repository: the map tooling reads
them to tell a broken save from a refused operation, out of process. Changing
one is a breaking change somewhere you cannot see from here.
