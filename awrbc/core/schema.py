"""Map JSON: the neutral interchange format.

This is the contract every other component is written against — the CLI converts
to and from it, the archive stores it, CI validates it, the editor edits it.

Two shape notes:

* The **JSON is row-major** (``terrain[y][x]``) because that is what reads
  correctly in a diff and on screen. The **save is column-major** rank-2
  ``[cols, rows]``. This module is where the transpose happens; nothing else
  should know about it.
* Per-tile extras are a single sparse ``cells`` list rather than several parallel
  lists. It carries ownership, capture progress, terrain HP and multi-tile
  offsets — everything that is not just "what terrain is here".

Values are raw game values. Friendly names are a presentation concern.
