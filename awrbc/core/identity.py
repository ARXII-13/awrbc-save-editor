"""Stable map identity.

The id is a content hash. It identifies a *file*: the archive dedupes on it, the
catalog records it, and it is the join key the future ratings database will use.
So it has to stay the same for the same map forever — including after the game
has opened and re-saved it.

It is not the archive path. Which map a file belongs to is its folder, and which
revision is its filename (decisions #8 and #43). The hash says
which exact bytes, which is a different question and stays a different field.

That is why the hashed subset is narrower than the file:

* **Volatile editor state** (``LastCursorPosition``, ``IsNew``, ...) changes just
  from opening a map in the Design Room. Never stored, never hashed.
* **name and author** are excluded so renaming a map does not create a new one.
* **flags** are excluded because they are suspected autotile/sprite variants the
  game may recompute. Structure membership lives in bits 29/30, but the same
  information is already carried by terrain type plus cell offsets, so dropping
  flags from the hash loses nothing and protects against churn.
