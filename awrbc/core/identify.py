"""Confirm a save actually belongs to this game.

Without this, pointing the tool at another title's save produces a confusing
error — the stream parses as NRBF, the members we look for are simply absent,
and the failure surfaces as "save version None is not supported", which tells the
user nothing useful.

Two independent signals, with different availability:

1. **The root class inside the maps file** — ``AW.UserGeneratedContent``, from
   ``Assembly-CSharp``. Always present, because it is the file we operate on.
   This is the primary check.
2. **The title id in ``ExtraData0``** — ``0100300012F2A000``. Definitive, but it
   lives three levels up from the maps file and only exists when the full
   Ryujinx save directory is present. A JKSV dump of just ``SaveData`` will not
   have it, so its absence is not evidence of anything.

Matching (1) accepts. A mismatch on (2) rejects even if (1) matched, since a
wrong title id means the file was taken from somewhere unexpected.
