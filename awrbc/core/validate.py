"""Map checks.

Returns structured findings, never text. The CLI renders them, CI keys off the
codes, and the editor shows them live — so the codes are a stable contract.

Severity decides what blocks:

* ``error``   — blocks publishing to the archive, and blocks writing to a save
* ``warning`` — advisory; design choices, not defects

**Validation is advisory on export and blocking on publish.** Refusing to export
a work-in-progress map would be obnoxious; refusing to publish an unplayable one
is correct.
