"""Derived data.

The game keeps a parallel ``CustomMapMetadata`` record holding counts that are
computable from the grid. It is regenerated here rather than carried through,
because stale counts make the in-game browser show wrong numbers.

The per-team breakdown is also stored in the map JSON. That is not redundancy:
``CustomMapMetadata`` provably cannot express playability - two maps with
identical metadata differ in validity by one unit - so the archive would have to
re-parse every map to answer "is this playable" without it.
