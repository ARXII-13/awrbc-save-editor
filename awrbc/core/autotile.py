"""Compute TileFlags from terrain.

Flags select sprites, and the game renders what the save tells it to rather
than recomputing them. So anything that authors a map has to author flags too,
or the map renders wrong. This module is that.

(An earlier version of this docstring said zeroed flags crash Versus. That was
retracted - the black screen was a Ryujinx input-config problem, not the map.
See docs/format.md. Whether zero actually breaks anything is untested.)

Six independent things share the one 32-bit field:

    bit 0       set on terrain that has no connection mask
    bits 1-4    connection mask: N, W, E, S
    bits 1-4    again, as a facing on a structure's anchor
    bits 5-8    inner shoreline corners, sea only
    bits 12-16  per-team sprite, HQ only
    bits 18-25  decorative variant, chosen at random by the editor
    bits 29,30  multi-tile structure: 30 anchor, 29 body

Derived by correlating ~1,900 tiles of game-authored maps against their
neighbours; see docs/format.md. Terrain that carries a connection mask is
reproduced exactly. Decorative variants are not reproducible and do not need
to be - identical neighbourhoods carry nine different values, so the game is
picking at random too.
