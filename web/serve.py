"""Static server for the editor, with caching turned off.

`python -m http.server` lets the browser cache ES modules aggressively, so an
edit to render.js or terrain.js can appear to have no effect - and you end up
debugging code the page is not running. That cost half an hour once already.

    python serve.py [port] [host]

Binds to localhost by default. Pass 0.0.0.0 to reach it from another machine
on the same network, which is how the other test desktop uses it.

Threaded, which is not optional here. A browser holds keep-alive connections
open, and a single-threaded HTTPServer serves exactly one at a time - so one
idle tab wedges the server for every other client, including the second
machine. That looked exactly like the server having crashed.
