"""The sprite pack that ships in the repository.

Commander Wars art is almost all masks: a pixel's red and green are (x, y)
into a biome palette, and `build_terrain.py` resolves them at build time. Pick
the wrong palette and the art still builds, still loads and still draws - it
just draws in the wrong colours, which no amount of structural checking would
notice. Reef shipped that way once: resolved through the ground palette it came
out magenta coral on bright grass, and nothing failed.

Two things are pinned here. The palettes leave unused table entries at a
distinctive magenta, so magenta in the output means an index the palette does
not define - which is the mistake itself, visible in the pixels. And reef is
water terrain, so its art must sit on something sea-coloured rather than on the
plains tile the renderer lays under everything else.

Skipped where Pillow is absent; it is a build dependency, not a runtime one.
