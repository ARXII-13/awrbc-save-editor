"""What the save editor is allowed to contain.

The save editor is downloaded and writes to a file the game owns. The map
editor is hosted and talks to a public archive. They are shipped apart so they
stay separable, and this is the check that keeps them that way.

It is a test rather than a convention because the convention already failed
once: the first packaged build bundled the whole of `web/`, so the downloaded
save editor contained the editing engine, Export bundle, and the path that
submits a map to the archive - Submit button and CC BY licence dialog with it.
Nothing failed, nothing warned, and it shipped.
