"""Build the desktop app into a zip somebody can unzip and run.

    pip install -e ".[package]"
    python tools/build_desktop.py

Produces `dist/awrbc-<platform>.zip` holding one folder: the executable, its
runtime, and the editor with its sprite pack. No installer (decision #55) -
an installer is a thing to trust, and this writes to a save file people care
about; a folder they can look inside asks for less.

Not run by CI. It needs a machine of the target platform, and what it makes is
a release artifact rather than a check. The smoke test at the end is the part
worth keeping honest: a build that cannot find its own editor still produces a
zip, and nobody would know until they ran it.
